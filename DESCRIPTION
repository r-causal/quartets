Description: In the spirit of Anscombe's quartet, this package includes datasets
   that demonstrate the importance of visualizing your data, the importance of 
   not relying on statistical summary measures alone, and why additional 
   assumptions about the data generating mechanism are needed when estimating 
   causal effects.
